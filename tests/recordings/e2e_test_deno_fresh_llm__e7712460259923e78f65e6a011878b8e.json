    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"deno-fresh\" appears to use a build system that involves Deno, a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime. Here's a breakdown of the files and their potential roles:\n\n1. **deno.json**: This file is likely a configuration file for Deno. It might contain settings related to the project, such as dependencies, scripts, and other build-related configurations.\n\n2. **main.ts**: This file is a TypeScript file, which is a common language for building modern web applications and server-side applications. It's possible that this file contains the main entry point of the application.\n\n3. **universalbuild.json**: This file could be a custom configuration file used for a universal build system. It might contain settings specific to the build process, such as build targets, optimization options, and other build-related configurations.\n\nOverall, the repository \"deno-fresh\" appears to use a build system that involves Deno and TypeScript, with custom configuration files for project-specific settings.",

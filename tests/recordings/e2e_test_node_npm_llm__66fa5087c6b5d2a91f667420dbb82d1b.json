    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, here's an analysis of the repository to identify build system manifests:\n\n1. **package-lock.json**: This file is specific to npm (Node Package Manager) and is used to lock down the exact versions of dependencies that are installed. It is not a build system manifest but rather a dependency management file.\n\n2. **package.json**: This file is also specific to npm and contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It is not a build system manifest but rather a project configuration file.\n\n3. **tsconfig.json**: This file is specific to TypeScript and is used to configure the TypeScript compiler. It is not a build system manifest but rather a TypeScript configuration file.\n\n4. **localhost-peelbox-test-single-language-node-npm-latest.tar**: This file is a tar archive and does not appear to be related to any build system manifest.\n\n5. **universalbuild.json**: This file is not a standard build system manifest. It could potentially be a custom configuration file used by the project for some purpose, but without more context, it's difficult to determine its exact purpose.\n\nIn summary, the repository contains several files that are not build system manifests, but rather configuration files for dependency management, project metadata, and TypeScript compilation. The only file that could potentially be a build system manifest is `universalbuild.json`, but its purpose is unclear without more context.",

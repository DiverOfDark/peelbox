    "content": "The repository \"java-gradle\" contains build system manifests for a Java project using Gradle. The main build configuration file is `build.gradle`, which is written in Groovy and is used to define the project's build logic, dependencies, and other settings. The `settings.gradle` file is also present, which is used to configure the build environment and define the projects included in the build. Additionally, there is a `universalbuild.json` file, which may contain build-related configuration or metadata. The repository also includes a `localhost-peelbox-test-single-language-java-gradle-latest.tar` file, which is likely a test or build artifact.",

    "content": "The repository `node-pnpm` appears to use a combination of build systems and tools. Here's a breakdown of the files and their potential roles:\n\n1. **.nvmrc**: This file is used by Node Version Manager (nvm) to specify the Node.js version that should be used for the project. It's not directly related to a build system but helps in setting up the correct environment.\n\n2. **package.json**: This is a standard file for Node.js projects that contains metadata about the project and its dependencies. It's also used by npm and pnpm to manage the project's dependencies and scripts.\n\n3. **pnpm-lock.yaml**: This file is specific to pnpm and is used to lock the versions of the dependencies to ensure that the project builds consistently across different environments. It's not a build system manifest but a dependency management tool's lock file.\n\n4. **tsconfig.json**: This file is used by TypeScript to configure the TypeScript compiler. It's not a build system manifest but a configuration file for TypeScript.\n\n5. **universalbuild.json**: This file is not a standard file for Node.js or TypeScript projects. It might be a custom file used by the project for some specific purpose, such as configuring a universal build process.\n\nBased on the files present, the primary build system used in this repository is likely npm or pnpm, as both are mentioned in the file tree summary. The `package.json` file is the central configuration file for these build systems, and it contains scripts that can be used to build, test, and publish the project.",

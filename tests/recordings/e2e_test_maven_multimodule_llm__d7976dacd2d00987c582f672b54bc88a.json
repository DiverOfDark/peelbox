    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"maven-multimodule\" appears to use Maven as its build system. This conclusion is drawn from the presence of a `pom.xml` file, which is the primary configuration file for Maven projects. Additionally, the repository contains a `universalbuild.json` file, which could be used for defining build configurations or metadata in a format that is not specific to Maven. However, without further context or analysis of the contents of this file, its exact purpose cannot be determined.",

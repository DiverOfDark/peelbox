    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"ruby-bundler\" appears to be a Ruby project that uses Bundler for dependency management. Here's an analysis of the build system manifests:\n\n1. **Gemfile**: This is a key file in Ruby projects that lists all the dependencies required for the project. It is used by Bundler to install the necessary gems.\n\n2. **app.rb**: This is a Ruby file that contains the main application code. It is not directly related to the build system but is part of the application's source code.\n\n3. **localhost-peelbox-test-single-language-ruby-bundler-latest.tar**: This file is a tar archive, which could potentially contain build artifacts or test data. However, its name suggests it might be related to a specific testing or deployment setup.\n\n4. **universalbuild.json**: This file is a JSON file, which could be used for various purposes in a build system. It might contain configuration settings, build instructions, or other metadata related to the build process.\n\nGiven these files, the most likely build system manifest in this repository is the **Gemfile**. It is the primary file used by Bundler to manage dependencies and is essential for building and running the Ruby application.\n\n### Summary\n- **Build System Manifest**: `Gemfile`\n- **Other Files**: \n  - `app.rb`: Application code\n  - `localhost-peelbox-test-single-language-ruby-bundler-latest.tar`: Potentially build artifacts or test data\n  - `universalbuild.json`: Configuration or metadata file\n\nThis analysis suggests that the repository uses Bundler for dependency management and that the `Gemfile` is the primary build system manifest.",

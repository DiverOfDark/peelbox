    "content": "The repository \"gradle-multiproject\" appears to be using the Gradle build system. This can be identified by the presence of the following files:\n\n1. `build.gradle`: This is the main build script for Gradle projects. It contains the build configuration and tasks.\n2. `settings.gradle`: This file is used to configure the settings for a multi-project build. It specifies which projects are included in the build.\n3. `universalbuild.json`: While this file has a `.json` extension, its name suggests it might be used for configuration purposes in a way that is specific to the build system or the project.\n\nThe file tree summary also indicates that there are 5 files with the `.gradle` extension, which are likely additional build scripts or configurations for Gradle. There are also 4 files with the `.java` extension, which are Java source files, and 1 file with the `.json` extension, which could be a configuration file for the build system or the project.\n\nOverall, the presence of these files strongly suggests that the repository is using the Gradle build system.",

    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"turborepo\" appears to use a build system that involves multiple configuration files. Here's a breakdown of the files and their potential roles:\n\n1. **package.json**: This is a standard file for Node.js projects, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies. It often includes scripts for running build processes.\n\n2. **turbo.json**: This file is likely specific to the Turborepo build system. Turborepo is a monorepo tool that aims to improve the performance of monorepos by caching and parallelizing builds. The `turbo.json` file would contain configuration settings for Turborepo, such as build commands, dependencies, and caching strategies.\n\n3. **universalbuild.json**: This file name suggests that it might be a custom configuration file for a universal build system or a build system that supports multiple platforms or environments. The exact purpose and contents of this file would depend on the build system it is used with.\n\n### Potential Build System Manifests\n\n- **package.json**: This file is commonly used to define build scripts. For example:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"build\": \"tsc && webpack\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **turbo.json**: This file would contain configuration for Turborepo. An example might look like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"pipeline\": {\n      \"build\": {\n        \"cache\": true,\n        \"steps\": [\n          { \"run\": \"tsc\" },\n          { \"run\": \"webpack\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **universalbuild.json**: This file would depend on the specific build system it is used with. For example, if it is used with a custom build system, it might look like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"scripts\": [\n        \"tsc\",\n        \"webpack\"\n      ],\n      \"cache\": true\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe repository \"turborepo\" uses a combination of standard and custom configuration files to manage its build process. The `package.json` file is used to define build scripts, while the `turbo.json` and `universalbuild.json` files are specific to the Turborepo build system and a custom build system, respectively. The exact contents of these files would provide more detailed information about the build process and its configuration.",

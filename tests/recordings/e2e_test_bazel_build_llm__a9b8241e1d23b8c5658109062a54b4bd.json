    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"bazel-build\" appears to be using Bazel as its build system. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **BUILD file**: This is a key file in Bazel. It contains the build rules for the project. The presence of a `BUILD` file strongly indicates that Bazel is being used.\n\n2. **WORKSPACE file**: This file is also essential in Bazel. It defines the external dependencies and repositories that the project depends on. The presence of a `WORKSPACE` file further confirms that Bazel is the build system.\n\n3. **main.cc**: This is a C++ source file. While it doesn't directly indicate the build system, it suggests that the project is likely a C++ project, which is commonly built using Bazel.\n\n4. **universalbuild.json**: This file has a `.json` extension, but its name and content are not immediately indicative of a Bazel-specific file. However, given the presence of other Bazel-related files, it's possible that this file might be used for some configuration or metadata related to the build process.\n\nIn summary, the repository \"bazel-build\" is using Bazel as its build system, as evidenced by the presence of `BUILD` and `WORKSPACE` files. The other files (main.cc and universalbuild.json) do not directly indicate the build system but provide context about the project's language and potential additional configuration.",

    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository appears to use Gradle as its build system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **build.gradle.kts**: This is a Kotlin DSL (Domain Specific Language) file for Gradle. It is used to define the build configuration for the project. The `.kts` extension indicates that it is a Kotlin script file.\n\n2. **settings.gradle.kts**: This file is also written in Kotlin DSL and is used to configure the settings for the multi-project build. It specifies which projects are included in the build and other settings related to the build environment.\n\n3. **universalbuild.json**: This file is in JSON format and might be used for some configuration or metadata related to the build process. However, it is not a standard Gradle manifest file.\n\n### Summary\n- **Build System**: Gradle\n- **Manifest Files**:\n  - `build.gradle.kts`: Main build configuration file.\n  - `settings.gradle.kts`: Configuration file for multi-project builds.\n  - `universalbuild.json`: Possibly a custom configuration file.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The presence of `.kts` files indicates that the build scripts are written in Kotlin, which is a popular choice for Gradle due to its flexibility and powerful features.\n- The `universalbuild.json` file is not a standard Gradle manifest, so its purpose may vary depending on the project's requirements.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the repository is a Gradle-based Kotlin project with a multi-project structure, as indicated by the presence of `settings.gradle.kts`.",

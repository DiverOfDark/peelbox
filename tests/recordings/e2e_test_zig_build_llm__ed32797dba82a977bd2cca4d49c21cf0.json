    "content": "The repository \"zig-build\" contains two files: `build.zig` and `universalbuild.json`. \n\n- `build.zig` is a file with the `.zig` extension, which is the primary file extension for Zig, a systems programming language. Zig is known for its simplicity and safety, and it uses a build system called Zig Build. The `build.zig` file is likely a build manifest for Zig projects, defining how the project should be built, including dependencies, compiler flags, and other build-related settings.\n\n- `universalbuild.json` is a file with the `.json` extension, which is a common format for configuration files. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is widely used for data interchange between a server and a web application. The `universalbuild.json` file could be a configuration file for the build system, specifying settings that are applicable across different platforms or build configurations.\n\nBased on the file names and extensions, it appears that the repository uses a combination of Zig Build for building the project and a JSON file for configuration.",

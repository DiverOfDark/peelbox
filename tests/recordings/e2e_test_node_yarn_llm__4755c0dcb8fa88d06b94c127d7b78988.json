    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, the repository \"node-yarn\" appears to use a combination of build systems and tools. Here's a breakdown of the files and their potential roles:\n\n1. **package.json**: This is a standard file for Node.js projects, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies. It is often used in conjunction with npm or yarn for package management.\n\n2. **tsconfig.json**: This file is used for TypeScript projects. It specifies compiler options and the files to include in the compilation process.\n\n3. **yarn.lock**: This file is specific to Yarn, a package manager for JavaScript. It locks the versions of the packages to ensure that the same versions are installed across different environments.\n\n4. **universalbuild.json**: This file is not a standard build system manifest, but it could be a custom configuration file used by the project for build-related settings.\n\nGiven these files, the repository likely uses Yarn for package management and potentially TypeScript for development. The presence of a custom configuration file (`universalbuild.json`) suggests that there might be some additional build or development processes that are not covered by the standard build systems.\n\nTo get a more detailed understanding of the build process, you would need to examine the scripts section in the `package.json` file and any other custom scripts or commands defined in the repository.",

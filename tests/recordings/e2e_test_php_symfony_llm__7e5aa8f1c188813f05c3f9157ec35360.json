    "content": "Based on the file tree summary provided, here's an analysis of the repository to identify build system manifests:\n\n1. **composer.json**: This file is commonly used in PHP projects to manage dependencies and scripts. It is a build system manifest for Composer, which is a dependency manager for PHP.\n\n2. **universalbuild.json**: This file is not a standard build system manifest. It could be a custom configuration file used by the repository's build system or a tool specific to the project.\n\n3. **localhost-peelbox-test-single-language-php-symfony-latest.tar**: This file is a tar archive, which is not a build system manifest. It is likely a pre-built package or a backup of the project.\n\n4. **.json files**: There are two other JSON files in the repository, but their names are not provided. They could be build system manifests or configuration files for other tools used in the project.\n\n5. **.php files**: There are four PHP files in the repository. These are likely part of the project's source code and not build system manifests.\n\n6. **.yaml files**: There are two YAML files in the repository. YAML is often used for configuration files, so these could be build system manifests or configuration files for other tools used in the project.\n\nIn summary, the repository contains several files that could be build system manifests, including `composer.json`, `universalbuild.json`, and the two YAML files. The exact nature of these manifests would depend on the specific build system and tools used in the project.",
